# nakama-downloader-module

* I assume I have to contribute to Nakama by creating a new module that will provide the ability to download a file using provided parameters.
* The Nakama documentation states that it's not recommended to fork and contribute directly. Instead, it suggests creating a new module using Nakama's runtime features.
* Since the task allowed me to use either Go or TypeScript, I decided to move forward with Go.
* I set up the module using [the following page](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/server-framework/go-runtime).
